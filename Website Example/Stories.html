 <p> Students shared stories of depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thoughts. Some spoke of diagnosed conditions such as 
 obsessive compulsive disorder and bipolar disorder, and the distructive effect these conditions sometimes have on their education.</p>

<p> "I thought everything was my fault and I was just defective and bad and that this was what I deserved from life. I missed out on social life and extra-curricular activities because I struggled with acute feelings of social anxiety, self-hatred and fear. Now I have access to support, I can support others, too, and that's the best feeling I could ask for."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I hope my words might help some of you to see that you really aren't the only one. In my opinion, searching out for help in whatever small way you can manage, really is the best thing."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mental health issues are nothing to be ashamed of and affect almost everybody and it's about time everyone realised this and stopped skirting round the subject and faced it head-on. "</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"One thing I've found is that so many more people than you realise suffer from mental illnesses. As I've talked to friends, more and more of them have been telling me that they too suffer from the same things I do, or they have in the past."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"No matter how bad it gets and how much you think there is no hope and let your depression take over, you can always dig yourself out of that hole and find a way to manage your depression and you are not alone."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Get help, be heard, let yourself be supported. You're important."  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> "The support and education about them need to be on par with the education we get about other medical issues. If we learn about it in school, we will be more prepared when we get to university."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"As a fresher you are constantly reminded that this is supposed to be the 'time of your life'. When it feels like the worst time of your life you feel both a sense of guilt and a pressure to keep these negative thoughts to yourself."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I spent the first few weeks of uni hiding in my dorm room crying my eyes out. I was homesick and wasn't sure if I wanted to be there at all."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Mental health issues can start in childhood, and many students spoke about a history of depression or self-harming that they carried to university. But a new life can add pressures."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"My depression and anxiety started some time before I came to university, but leaving home, being in an extremely taxing social environment and being under large academic pressure all took their toll on me," said one student.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> "Getting tubes or being anywhere I didn't know felt uncertain. I always had a burning, itching, tormenting anxiety bubbling in my chest. At the time, my boyfriend had no comprehension of mental illness and would regularly tell me panic attacks didn't exist, that I was stupid and that I had no friends."</p>
