	 <h3> Self harm</h3> 
	 <p>  People often try to keep self-harm a secret because of shame or fear of it being seen. They may cover up their skin and avoid discussing the problem.
          It's often up to close family and friends to notice when somebody is self-harming. They should approach the subject with care and understanding.
